take-home kata done in java.

CONTEXT

take-home coding test solved in under 6 hours, whereas the tester gave 72 hours total.

POST-MORTEM

despite the timely solve, I was not asked to go forward with the role. looking back, the tester might have wanted more separation of concerns and classing, which I foregone for speed's sake. despite such, this solution produces perfect results down to the decimal point.
